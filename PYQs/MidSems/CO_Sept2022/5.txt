To calculate the address of the array element A[6][3][5] in a 3D array stored in row - major order, 
you can use the following formula:
Address = BaseAddress + [(i * (jmax * kmax) + j * kmax + k) * element_size]
Where:
    BaseAddress is the starting address of the array (in this case, 20000).
    i, j, and k are the indices of the element you want to calculate (in this case, 6, 3, and 5).
    jmax is the size of the second dimension (in this case, 5).
    kmax is the size of the third dimension (in this case, 10).
    element_size is the size (in bytes) of each element in the array.

Base Address = 20000
i=6, j=3, k=5
jmax=5, kmax=10
element_size = sizeof(A[0][0][0])  // Size of each element (assuming it's an integer)
Since, assumed as integer. So, element_size = 4 bytes
Address = 20000 + [(6 * (5*10) + 3*10 + 5) * 4] = 21340

Hence, address of array element A[6][3][5] = 21340
