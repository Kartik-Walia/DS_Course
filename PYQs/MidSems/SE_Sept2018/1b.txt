The provided C program contains three nested loops. 
Let's analyze the time and space complexity:
1. Inner Loop (for i)
    It runs n times, where n is variable
2. Middle Loop (for j)
    It runs n times for each iteration of outer loop 
    So, it effectively runs n*n times  
3. Outer Loop (for k)
    It runs 9999 times, which is constant
The total number of iterations is n*n*9999

TIME COMPLEXITY
Time Complexity of this program is O(n*n*9999), which can be simplified to O(n^2)

SPACE COMPLEXITY
Space Complexity of this program is O(1) bcoz it uses a constant amount of memory 
(only a few integer variables are used regardless of input size 'n')

Hence, Time complexity is O(n^2) and Space complexity is O(1)
