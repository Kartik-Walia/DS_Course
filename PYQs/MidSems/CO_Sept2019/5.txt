(A) The stack-life of an element m can be defined as the time elapsed from the end of Push(m) to the 
    start of the pop operation that removes m from the stack.
    Sequence of events for each element m:
    1. You push m onto the stack, which takes X seconds.
    2. You wait Y seconds.
    3. You pop m from the stack, which takes X seconds.
    So, Total time for stack life of m is X+Y+X= 2X+Y seconds
(B) To compute the average stack-life of an element in this stack, you need to consider all elements 
    from 1 to n and calculate their respective stack-lives. Then, take the average of these values.
