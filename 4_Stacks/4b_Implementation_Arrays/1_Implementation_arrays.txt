BASIC OPERATIONS ON STACK
In order to make manipulations in a stack, there are certain operations provided to us:
1. push()
    Adds an item to the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
2. pop()
    Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. 
    If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
3. top()
    Returns the top element of the stack.
4. isEmpty()
    Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.
5. size()
    Returns size of stack.
push() pop() top() isEmpty() all have time complexity of O(1)
